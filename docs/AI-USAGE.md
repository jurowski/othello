# AI Usage Index

I used AI as a coding assistant for self-contained tasks and then refactored & tested the results.

- Rules engine draft → `ai/prompts/2025-10-18-rules-engine.md`
- Redux slice scaffold → `ai/prompts/2025-10-18-redux-slice.md`
- React components scaffold → `ai/prompts/2025-10-18-react-ui.md`
- Vitest tests scaffold → `ai/prompts/2025-10-19-tests-vitest.md`

Inline file headers include `AI-ASSIST` comments pointing to the exact prompt files. I reviewed all generated code, adjusted types/logic, and added tests.
